                    Health insurance is a type of insurance that covers the cost of medical care. Health insurance can help you save money on medical expenses, including hospitalizations, prescriptions, and preventive care. Health insurance can also help you get discounts on health care services. Many health insurance plans offer discounts on health care services, including primary care visits, mental health counseling, and physical therapy. Health insurance can also help you pay for health care expenses that are not covered by your regular health insurance plan. For example, if you have a health plan with a $5,000 deductible and you incur $10,000 in medical expenses in a year, your health insurance will pay the remaining $5,000. This can help you save money on out-of-pocket costs.
